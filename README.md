#Cocos2dx Shooting Game 

##Introduction
A simple Touhou Project Doujin STG.
Designed for SmartPhone, only tested on Android, Game Engine using Cocos2dx 3.3.

I tried to use the open source 2D game engine for game development independently.
Cocos-2dx is an open source cross-platform 2D game engine based on C++. In the development process, because of the lack of documentation, I solved some version compatibility issues of the engine itself by reading the source code. And by writing my own C++ method, I have implemented the function of getting the resource file read progress which is not provided by the engine itself.
This game is a simple shooting game with only one test level. I may continue to complete this project in the future.
